# Hangman Game

This is a simple text-based Hangman game written in Python. The game randomly selects a word, and your goal is to guess the word one letter at a time before you run out of tries.

## How to Play
- Run the game using Python: `python hangman_similar.py`
- The game will display a hidden word with underscores for each letter.
- Guess one letter at a time by typing it and pressing Enter.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
- If the letter is not in the word, you lose a try and part of the hangman is drawn.
- You win if you guess all the letters before the hangman is fully drawn!

## Features
- Random word selection from a built-in list or from a `words.txt` file if present.
- ASCII art hangman display for each wrong guess.
- Option to play again after each game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

Enjoy playing and improving your vocabulary!
